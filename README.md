## Colonel Blotto
Simulations for a Blotto Game

# Introduction
The Colonel Blotto is as follows:

Each player places 100 indistinguishable knights into 10 different castles labeled from 1 to 10. A battle consists of two players comparing their armies castle by castle. The player who wins the most castles will win the battle and gain 1 point. If they tie, they will each gain 0.5 points.<br />

For Example:<br />
Castles:   1    2    3    4     5     6      7     8     9      10<br />
Player 1: 15  15    20    5     0     10     5     20    10     0<br />
Player 2:  3   8     6    13    9     8      1     39    13     0 <br />
Player 1 would win castles: 1,2,3,6,7 <br />
Player 2 would win castles 4,5,8,9 <br />
and nobody would win castle 10. <br />
Since player 1 won more castles than player 2, player 1 wins this battle.<br />


# Motivation
I want to try and see if an optimal strategy can be found using various distributions
